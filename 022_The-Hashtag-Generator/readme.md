#### Description:
The marketing team is spending way too much time typing in hashtags.
Let's help them with our own Hashtag Generator!

Here's the deal:

* It must start with a hashtag (`#`).
* All words must have their first letter capitalized.
* If the final result is longer than 140 chars it must return `false`.
* If the input or the result is an empty string it must return `false`.

#### Examples

```php
" Hello there thanks for trying my Kata"  =>  "#HelloThereThanksForTryingMyKata"
"    Hello     World   "                  =>  "#HelloWorld"
""                                        =>  false
```
