### [Same Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/same-tree/)
![Easy](https://img.shields.io/badge/Easy-26b7a6)

Given the roots of two binary trees `p` and `q`, write a function to check if they are the same or not.

Two binary trees are considered the same if they are structurally identical, and the nodes have the same value.


##### Example 1:

```php
Input: p = [1,2,3], q = [1,2,3]
Output: true
```

##### Example 2:

```php
Input: p = [1,2], q = [1,null,2]
Output: false
```


##### Example 3:

```php
Input: p = [1,2,1], q = [1,1,2]
Output: false
```


##### Constraints:

* The number of nodes in both trees is in the range `[0, 100]`.
* `-10^4 <= Node.val <= 10^4`
