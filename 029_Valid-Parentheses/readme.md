![Easy](https://img.shields.io/badge/Easy-26b7a6)

Given a string `s` containing just the characters `'('`, `')'`, `'{'`, `'}'`, `'['` and `']'`, determine if the input string is valid.

An input string is valid if:
- Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
- Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
- Every close bracket has a corresponding open bracket of the same type.


##### Example 1:

```php
Input: s = "()"
Output: true
```

##### Example 2:

```php
Input: s = "()[]{}"
Output: true
```

##### Example 3:

```php
Input: s = "(]"
Output: false
```


##### Constraints:

* `1 <= s.length <= 10^4`
* `s` consists of parentheses only `'()[]{}'`.
