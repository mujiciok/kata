### [Maximum Depth of Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-depth-of-binary-tree/)
![Easy](https://img.shields.io/badge/Easy-26b7a6)

Given the `root` of a binary tree, return _its maximum depth_.

A binary tree's **maximum depth** is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.


##### Example 1:

```php
Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: 3
```

##### Example 2:

```php
Input: root = [1,null,2]
Output: 2
```


##### Constraints:

* The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 10^4]`.
* `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`
